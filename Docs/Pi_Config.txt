Pi configuration 3-6-23
_________________________

SPI on Pi must be turned on for MCP AtoD to work, use (sudo raspi-config)

Scripts and Python code loaded in /home/pi/bin/Hydroponics/

crontab.pi should be the pi user's crontab (to wrap logs)

rc.local should be copied to /etc (or the one there edited to start Python code at boot)

Make sure scripts have execute bit set chmod 755

Hydroponics code runs as the pi user
