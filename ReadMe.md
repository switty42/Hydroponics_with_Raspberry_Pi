# Hydroponics with Raspberry Pi
Docs 3-4-23 V1 (For questions or comments:  Stephen Witty switty@level500.com)  

### Project Overview:
This project is a work in progres exploring the usage of the Raspberry Pi and sensors to automate a Hydroponics system.  The project is a group collaboration effort between @switty, @WW and @vetch.  We intend to use soil sensors to monitor moisture levels across the system. When needed the system will automatically supply water via a pump controlled via electronic relay.  We will also explore the usage of other sensor types and methodologies.  Data for analysis and reporting will be sent via Bluetooth relay to a Helium LoRa MCU which will publish the data to a backend website.
